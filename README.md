## Description

Each mat file represents one realization. 
Varibles Sg1, Sg2, Sg3, Sg4, and Sg5 are the gas saturaiton fields simulated by the FH model after 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 pore volume of gas is injected.
Varibles Sg1h, Sg2h, Sg3h, Sg4h, and Sg5h are the gas saturaiton fields simulated by the RP model after 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 pore volume of gas is injected.
The first row, first column of every matrix (for example k(1,1)) represents the left bottom corner cell in the domain.
