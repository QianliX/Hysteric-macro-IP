## Description

input.mat includes three input varibles: initial NAPL saturation (Snw), permeability distribution (k), and water pressure (Pw). 

This dataset also includes the output simulated by the model: gas saturation (Sg), NAPL saturation (Sn), temperature (T).

The number in file names indicates the time step when the data is recorded. For example, Sg10.mat represents the gas saturation at t=1 day and Sn4.mat represents the NAPL saturation at t=0.4 day.

The first row, first column of every matrix (for example T(1,1)) represents the left bottom corner cell in the domain.
